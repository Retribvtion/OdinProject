Chess game, developed for [The Odin's Final Project: Chess](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/ruby-final-project).

To run the game, run <code> ruby lib/game.rb </code>

The game was tested using "caveman's" approach, aka using lots of print statements. I am currently writing RSpec tests for the major parts, as well as refactoring some code. I will be updating this paragraph as needed :)
