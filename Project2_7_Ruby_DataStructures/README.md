These are Data Structures and Algorithms project for [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/data-structures-and-algorithms).

The projects include:

1. Building a simple binary tree data structure from some arbitrary input and a 'crawler' function that locates data inside of it.

2. Building a Knight's Travails project, which shows the simplest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.
