A mimick of the Eventbrite app, which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. An event owner can choose to create an event by invitation only (the default option). Once a user clicks 'join for this event', the event owner will have to approve the request.

This is the [Associations Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/associations) done for The Odin Project.
