This is a Micro-Reddit project for The Odin Project Curriculum
@http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/building-with-active-record.
The goal is to practice building the data structures necessary to
support link submissions and commenting.



Steps for the project:

1. Create project => rails new micro-reddit
2. Generate User model with fields => rails generate model User username:string email:string password:string
3. Migrate DB => rake db:migrate
4. Create User validatations =>
    validates :username, presence: true, length: {maximum: 20}
    validates :email, presence: true

Posts:
1. Generate Post model with fields => rails generate model Post content:string user_id:integer (user_id is a foreign key)
2. Migrate DB => rake db:migrate
3. Create Post validations => validates :user_id, presence: true
3. Add associations:
    User model => has_many :posts
    Post model: => belongs_to :user

Comments:
1. Create Comment model with fields => rails generate model Comment content:string user_id:integer
2. Add index field => rails generate migration AddPostIdToComments post_id:integer:index (adding a post_id as an index, since I forgot to do it in the first step)
3. Add associations:
    User model => has_many :comments
    Comment model => belongs_to :post belongs_to :user
    Post model => has_many :comments
4. Create Comment validations =>
    validates :user_id, presence: true
    validates :post_id, presence:true

Extra steps => rails generate migration RemovePasswordFromUsers password:string # decided to get rid of the password field
rake db:migrate
