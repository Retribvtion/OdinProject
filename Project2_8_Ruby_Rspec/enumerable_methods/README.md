Additional tests written for the enumerable methods exercise from [The Odin's Advanced Building Blocks Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/advanced-building-blocks). This version of the tests is more refined and follows 'best-practices' as compared with the earlier project.

Change into <code>enumerable_methods</code> directory and run <code>rake spec</code>
